    "If our sample characterized by three parameters (X, Y, Z), then the scatter plot has 3 dimensions. The boundary between the classes in the 3-D plot is a plane. Because of the fact that the method can be extrapolated at N-dimensions, the boundary is a *hyperplane*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, linear boundaries may not be optimal and a non-linear SVM should be used instead. The left panel of Figure 3.5 shows an 2D scatter plot of two different classes (e.g. red and green stars with different radii and temperatures) which cannot be linearly separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find non-linear boundaries we can tackle the problem in an higher dimensional space. We use a process called **kernelization**, which consists in using a kernel function to attribute to our data a value in the additional dimension. Then, we draw the decision hyperplane into this higher dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central panel of Figure 3.5 shows that once the 2D data are mapped to a 3D space by attributing a $z$ value through a Gaussian-like function, the classes are easily separable by a 3D hyperplane. Projecting back the plane in 2D, we obtain the non-linear boundary (Figure 3.5, rght panel).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Choosing the kernel function\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful kernel functions shall satisfy specific conditions, so that in practice only a few are used. In the example of Figure 3.5, the Gaussian Radial Basis Function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K(x,y) = e^{-\\gamma(x-y)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",

A decision tree presents the drawback of learning extremely well the training set. That means that DTs overfit the data and they cannot predict very accurately new data.\n",

When RF are used as a classification method, for each input datum the final output is the class (/value) given by the mode of the classes of the individual trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RF creates a large number of DTs through random selection of a subset of the training set as well as a random selection of features. This randomness reduces the correlation between the different DTs. Since the DTs have different conditions in their nodes and different overall structures, this diversity yield overall robust predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the RF has been trained, the data of an **unlabeled** source (to be classified) are  fed into all DTs of the forest. According to its properties and the nodes in each DT, it follows a specific path which leads to a given class. The final output of the RF (the prediction) is an aggregation of all DTs by means of a majority vote.\n",

    "## Final remarks on Random Forests\n",

    "In machine learning most of the effort is actually spent on the **sample** selection and, most importantly, on the selection of the **features** used for the classification (feature engineering).\n",
