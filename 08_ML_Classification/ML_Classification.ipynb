When RF are used as a classification method, for each input datum the final output is the class (/value) given by the mode of the classes of the individual trees.\n",

    "RF creates a large number of DTs through random selection of a subset of the training set as well as a random selection of features. This randomness reduces the correlation between the different DTs. Since the DTs have different conditions in their nodes and different overall structures, this diversity yield overall robust predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the RF has been trained, the data of an **unlabeled** source (to be classified) are  fed into all DTs of the forest. According to its properties and the nodes in each DT, it follows a specific path which leads to a given class. The final output of the RF (the prediction) is an aggregation of all DTs by means of a majority vote.\n",
