    "\n",
    "A globally optimal minimum is not guaranteed (might converge to a local minimum). This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids. This is why, in practice, K-means is run multiple times with different starting values selecting the result with the lowest sum-of-squares error. To improve on that we can initially select centrodis that are generally distant from each other (sklearn implementation by using `init='k-means++'` parameter). For more see [Grouping data points with k-means clustering, by Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/grouping-data-points-with-k-means-clustering/).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",

    "- The number of clusters (K) must be provided (or cross-validated)\n",
    "- There is an inherit assumption of isotropic clusters (i.e. not well fitted for elongated clusters, or manifolds with irregular shapes)\n",
    "- Inertia is not a normalized metric: lower values are better , but as the dimensions increase so does the inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative for faster implementation - Mini Batch K-means\n",
    "\n",
    "For faster computations the sklearn offers the [Mini Batch K-means](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#mini-batch-kmeans) method which simply breaks the initial set of observations/data points to smaller randomly selected subsamples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each subsample in the mini batch the assigned centroid is updated by taking into account the average of that subsample and all previous subsamples assigned to that centroid. This is repeated until the predefined number of iterations is reached. Its results are generally only slightly worse then the standard algorithm."
